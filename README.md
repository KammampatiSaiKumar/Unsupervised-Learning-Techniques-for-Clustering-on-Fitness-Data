This project applies various unsupervised learning techniques to cluster fitness data.
Clustering Algorithms: Application of K-means, GaussianMixture, SpectralClustering, Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering.
Evaluation: Using Elbow and Dendrogram techniques to determine the optimal number of clusters and evaluating clustering performance with Silhouette scores, Calinski-Harabasz Index, and Davies-Bouldin Index.
