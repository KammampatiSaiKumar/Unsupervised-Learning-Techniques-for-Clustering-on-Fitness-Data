This project applies various unsupervised learning techniques to cluster fitness data.
Data Exploration: Analyzing and visualizing fitness data.
Preprocessing: Data cleaning, normalization, and scaling.
Clustering Algorithms: Application of K-means, Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN.
Evaluation: Using Elbow and Dendrogram techniques to determine the optimal number of clusters and evaluating clustering performance with Silhouette scores.
